#RailsWeekly

##A Ruby on Rails personal challenge app.

The idea for RailsWeekly came from seeing artists, designers and illustrators work on small projects daily, to improve workflow, hone skills, or just relax.  Rails devs like to iterate and build apps quickly too, so I started RailsWeekly as a system to tap into the inspiration and challenge of working on lots of short, small projects.
